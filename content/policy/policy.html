        <p>Serify knows that you care about how your personal information is collected, used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. By accessing the website at <a href="http://Serify.org">http://Serify.org</a> or any Serify mobile application (i.e., Serify iOS or Serify Android) (collectively, the &ldquo;Service&rdquo;), which are provided by Serify LLC (&ldquo;Serify&rdquo;), you expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information (as defined below) in accordance with this privacy policy (&ldquo;Privacy Policy.&rdquo;) We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe Serify&rsquo;s policies and practices regarding the Personal Information we collect from users of the Service.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Company&rdquo; or the terms &ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo; or similar terms refer to Serify. &ldquo;You&rdquo; or &ldquo;your&rdquo; or similar terms refer to you as a user of our services.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Your privacy is important to us and we will not share your information except as described in this Privacy Policy. Any capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the same meaning as described in our Terms of Service. If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at info@Serify.org and write &ldquo;Privacy&rdquo; in the subject line.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify this policy at any time, and without prior notice, by giving notice via e-mail of our amended terms on our website (<a href="http://Serify.org">http://Serify.org</a>). Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any updates. The most recent revision date is at the top of this web page.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>A Note about Minors</strong></p>
        <p>The Service is intended for users 13 years and older, or dependent upon your state of residence and if you have the right to enter into contractual agreement as defined by federal and state law.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>A Note to Users outside the United States</strong></p>
        <p>Your Personal Information may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>If you do not agree with the policies and procedures described in the Privacy Policy, do not access or use the Service.</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Information We Collect and Use</strong></p>
        <p>Serify collects and analyzes information to improve your experience using the Service. We use the information collected to help you access and use your account, and verify and share your Records. We also use your information to fix technical issues, monitor metrics, ensure that Users comply with our Terms of Service and applicable laws, and generally understand how the Service is used.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Serify receives your name, email address, date of birth, password, signature, records, and other personally identifiable information (collectively, the &ldquo;<strong>Personal Information</strong>&rdquo;) to help you use the Service. <strong>Any Personal Information provided by you, health care provider(s), or testing service(s) will not be shared via the service unless you choose to do so</strong>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If you purchase a single verification or subscription service from us, we (or our third party service provider) will collect all information necessary to complete the transaction, including your name, credit card information, billing information, address, telephone number, and email address. If we use a third party service provider, the service provider may provide certain information back to us (e.g., your name, phone number, partial credit card number, and email address). Serify does not receive or process credit card information directly.&nbsp;At this time, we do not offer the option to make any purchases.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Serify's servers automatically record information ("Log Files") created by your use of the service. Log Files may include information such as your IP address, browser type, the referring domain, pages visited, and search terms. Other actions may also be included in Log Files.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Your browser may offer you a &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites.&nbsp; Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>How Your Personal Information is Used</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>General Use of Your Personal Information. </strong>To create the best possible service and functionality for Users, we use your Personal Information in the following ways and as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy: (a) to identify you as a user on the Service; (b) to improve the Service; (c) to provide the services you request, including the Service; (d) to respond to your inquiries related to support, employment opportunities or other requests; (e) to fulfill a product or service purchase; and (f) to conduct a Partner Promotion that you voluntarily entered into as described below.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Creation of Anonymous Data. </strong>Serify may create Anonymous Data records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data personally identifiable to you. We use this Anonymous Data to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the Service. Serify reserves the right to use Anonymous Data for any purpose and disclose Anonymous Data to third parties in its sole discretion.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</strong>. We disclose Personal Information and Anonymous Data, as described below (and elsewhere in this Privacy Policy).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Important note about profile information. You understand that when you use the Service, the health information you have requested to be verified, along with the information you provide on your profile, will be made public. Do not request to verify health information or otherwise include information on your profile that you want to keep private. </strong>Service users will be provided with a profile link through which their profiles may be publicly accessed. Even if you do not share this profile link, sophisticated visitors to our website or mobile application may nevertheless be able to view your profile. <strong>You hereby consent to the disclosure of your profile information and the health information you requested to be verified.</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Third Parties.</strong> We may also provide your Personal Information or Anonymous Data to approved vendors for their use in assisting us with the maintenance and operation of the Service, including for disseminating Serify&rsquo;s email and text messaging communications. For example, a third party vendor may have access to your Personal Information in order to support our information technology or help obtain, compile and manage the data. All Serify vendors are subject to applicable federal and state laws regarding consumer privacy. For more information on who has access to your Personal Information, please see our Security Statement.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Other Disclosures</strong>. We also disclose your Personal Information as required or permitted by law, including complying with legal process (e.g., we may disclose your information as necessary to comply with an authorized civil, criminal or regulatory investigation). We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities and may, in our sole discretion, disclose personal information or other information to satisfy any law, regulation, subpoena, or government request. We reserve the right to release Personal Information or other information about Users who we believe are engaged in illegal activities or are otherwise in violation of our Terms of Service, even without a subpoena, warrant or court order, if we believe, in our sole discretion, that such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to operate our Service or to protect the rights or property of the Company, our affiliates, or our officers, directors, employees, agents, third-party content providers, suppliers, sponsors, or licensors. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities we reasonably believe in our sole discretion to be unlawful. For example, if we reasonably believe that one of our Users has committed identity theft, we will report such User to the proper law enforcement agency. If we are legally compelled to disclose your Personal Information to a third party, we will attempt to notify you by sending an email to the email address in our records unless doing so would violate the law or unless you have not provided your correct email address to us.</p>
