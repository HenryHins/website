	    <br>
		These Terms and Conditions of Use (the "Terms of Use") apply to the Serify web site located at <a href="https://serify.org">https://serify.org</a>, and all associated sites linked to <a href="https://serify.org">https://serify.org</a> by Serify, its subsidiaries and affiliates, including Serify sites around the world (collectively, the "Service"). The Service is the property of Serify Inc. ("Serify") and its licensors.
		<strong>By using the Service, you agree to these Terms of Use; if you do not agree, do not use the Service.</strong>
		<br><br>
		Serify reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of these Terms of Use, at any time. Any notices or other communications provided by Serify under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Service. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted. 
		<br><br>
		Your continued use of the Service following the posting of changes will mean that you accept and agree to the changes. As long as you comply with these Terms of Use, Serify grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited privilege to enter and use the Service.
		<br><br>
		These Terms of Use constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Serify and you regarding the Service and Content (defined below), and these Terms of Use supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Serify and you regarding the Service and Content. You may not assign or transfer these Terms of Use, by operation of law or otherwise, without Serify’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms of Use, without such consent, will be null. Serify may freely assign or transfer these Terms of Use without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms of Use will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
		<br><br>
		<strong>Serify’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Serify. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms of Use, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms of Use will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms of Use or otherwise.</strong>
		<br><br>

		<h3>Content and Content Rights</h3>
		<br>
		For purposes of these Terms: (i) <strong>"Content"</strong> means text, graphics, images, music, software, audio, video, works of authorship of any kind, and information or other materials that are posted, generated, provided or otherwise made available through the Service; and (ii) <strong>"User Content"</strong> means any Content that you provide to be made available through the Service (including your health information).
		<br><br>
		Except as expressly provided in these Terms of Use, no part of the Service and no Content may be copied, reproduced, republished, uploaded, posted, publicly displayed, encoded, translated, transmitted or distributed in any way (including "mirroring") to any other computer, server, Web site or other medium for publication or distribution or for any commercial enterprise, without Serify’s express prior written consent.

However, in certain instances, some of your User Information may not be completely removed and copies of your User Information may continue to exist on the Service for archival or backup purposes or to the extent required by applicable laws.

		<h3>Disclaimers</h3>
		<br>
		<strong>Serify does not promise that the Service or any Content or feature of the Service will be error-free or uninterrupted, or that any defects will be corrected, or that your use of the Service will provide specific results.

		<br><br>
		The above disclaimer applies to any damages, liability or injuries caused by any failure of performance, error, omission, interruption, deletion, defect, delay in operation or transmission, computer virus, communication line failure, theft or destruction of or unauthorized access to, alteration of, or use, whether for breach of contract, tort, negligence or any other cause of action.

		Except where prohibited by law, in no event will Serify be liable to you for any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental or punitive damages, including lost profits, even if Serify has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		<br><br>
		If, notwithstanding the other provisions of these Terms of Use, Serify is found to be liable to you for any damage or loss which arises out of or is in any way connected with your use of the Service or any Content, Serify’s liability shall in no event exceed the greater of (1) the total of any subscription or similar fees with respect to any service or feature of or on the Service paid in the six months prior to the date of the initial claim made against Serify (but not including the purchase price for any Serify services), or (2) US$100.00. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations of liability, so the foregoing limitation may not apply to you.
		<br><br>
		Furthermore, by agreeing to the Terms of Use, you release Serify from the liability of ensuring the information provided on this site is accurate and true. When the validity of the information is provided is required, you agree to be personal responsible for that independent validation and to not use Serify or the information Serify provides as a replacement for that process.
		<br><br>

		<h3>Indemnity</h3>
		<br>
		You agree to indemnify and hold Serify, its officers, directors, shareholders, predecessors, successors in interest, employees, agents, subsidiaries and affiliates, harmless from any demands, loss, liability, claims or expenses (including attorneys’ fees), made against Serify by any third party due to or arising out of or in connection with your use of the Service.
		<br><br>

		<h3>Violation of These Terms of Use</h3>
		<br>
		Serify may disclose any information we have about you (including your identity) if we determine that such disclosure is necessary in connection with any investigation or complaint regarding your use of the Service, or to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Serify’s rights or property, or the rights or property of visitors to or users of the Service, including Serify’s customers. Serify reserves the right at all times to disclose any information that Serify deems necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. Serify also may disclose your information when Serify determines that applicable law requires or permits such disclosure, including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection purposes.
		<br><br>
		You acknowledge and agree that Serify may preserve any transmittal or communication by you with Serify through the Service or any service offered on or through the Service, and may also disclose such data if required to do so by law or Serify determines that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) comply with legal process, (2) enforce these Terms of Use, (3) respond to claims that any such data violates the rights of others, or (4) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Serify, its employees, users of or visitors to the Service, and the public.
		<br><br>

You also agree that any violation by you of these Terms of Use will constitute an unlawful and unfair business practice, and will cause irreparable harm to Serify, for which monetary damages would be inadequate, and you consent to Serify obtaining any injunctive or equitable relief that Serify deems necessary or appropriate in such circumstances. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies Serify may have at law or in equity.
		<br><br>
		You agree that Serify may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice, terminate your access to the Service, for cause, which includes (but is not limited to) (1) requests by law enforcement or other government agencies, (2) a request by you (self-initiated account deletions), (3) discontinuance or material modification of the Service or any service offered on or through the Service, or (4) unexpected technical issues or problems.
		<br><br>
		If Serify does take any legal action against you as a result of your violation of these Terms of Use, Serify will be entitled to recover from you, and you agree to pay, all reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of such action, in addition to any other relief granted to Serify. You agree that Serify will not be liable to you or to any third party for termination of your access to the Service as a result of any violation of these Terms of Use.
		<br><br>

You agree to the personal jurisdiction by and venue in the state and federal courts in San Francisco County, California, and waive any objection to such jurisdiction or venue. The preceding provision regarding venue does not apply if you are a consumer based in the European Union. If you are a consumer based in the European Union, you may make a claim in the courts of the country where you reside. Any claim under these Terms of Use must be brought within one (1) year after the cause of action arises, or such claim or cause of action is barred. Claims made under the separate terms and conditions of purchase for goods and services are not subject to this limitation. No recovery may be sought or received for damages other than out-of-pocket expenses, except that the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees. In the event of any controversy or dispute between Serify and you arising out of or in connection with your use of the Service, the parties shall attempt, promptly and in good faith, to resolve any such dispute. If we are unable to resolve any such dispute within a reasonable time (not to exceed thirty (30) days), then either party may submit such controversy or dispute to mediation. If the dispute cannot be resolved through mediation, then the parties shall be free to pursue any right or remedy available to them under applicable law.
