		<h2>About Serify</h2>

		<h3>Which clinics does Serify work with?</h3>
		Serify work with most clinics in the United States. If you are interested in which clinics are not supported or are not in the United States and wish to use our service, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:info@serify.org">info@serify.org</a>.

		<h3>What happens if my STD test result is positive?</h3>
		Serify only requests and verifies negative STD test results. Unverified and positive test results are not shown on the public profile and are automatically flagged for your review.

		<h3>Does a Serify negative status mean that the person is actually negative?</h3>
		No. Serify is a service that verifies the medical information on file at testing clinics. We cannot guarantee whether that information on file is accurate or not. In addition, there is a small but non-negligible chance that a person who has an STD may have a negative test result or a person may contract an STD after having been tested. Please refer to the <a ng-click="TermsButtonClick()">Terms of Use</a> for additional information.

		<h3>How much does it cost to be Serified?</h3>
		Your first set of verifications will always be free. It is Serify's mission to support improved social benefits. Currently, all verifications are free for our beta users.
